simple-wp-update-control
=========================

A Wordpress plugin that hides major core Wordpress, plugin, and theme update notifications for better version control. Also disables all auto-updates but minor/security Wordpress updates.

Works with Wordpress 3.7+.

Confirmed the minor updates are allowed on a test install updating from 3.8.1 to 3.8.2.
